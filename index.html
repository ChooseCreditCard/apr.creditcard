    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Is APR on a Credit Card?</h2>
      <p>APR (Annual Percentage Rate) is a way of expressing the yearly cost of borrowing on a credit card. It combines the base interest rate with certain fees to show an annualized cost, but interest is usually charged on a daily basis on outstanding balances.</p>
      <p>Credit cards often have multiple APRs, including separate rates for purchases, cash advances, balance transfers and sometimes promotional offers. Which APR applies depends on how the card is used and whether the statement is paid in full.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Mechanics -->
    <section id="mechanics" class="section">
      <h2>How Daily Interest and Grace Periods Work</h2>
      <p>Most issuers calculate interest using a daily periodic rate. They take the APR, divide it by 365 (or 360 in some cases) and apply the result to your average daily balance.</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>Purchase APR</strong> – applied to unpaid purchase balances after the grace period.</li>
        <li><strong>Daily periodic rate</strong> – APR divided by the number of days in the year.</li>
        <li><strong>Average daily balance</strong> – balance tracked across each day in the cycle.</li>
        <li><strong>Grace period</strong> – if you pay the full statement balance on time, some issuers do not charge interest on new purchases for that cycle.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you carry a balance, the grace period may not apply to new purchases, meaning interest can start accruing immediately according to the terms in your card agreement.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Purchase APR, Cash Advances &amp; Other Rates</h2>
      <p>Many cards advertise one headline APR, but there can be several underlying rates:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>Purchase APR</strong> – for everyday card purchases.</li>
        <li><strong>Cash-advance APR</strong> – for ATM withdrawals or similar transactions, often higher and with no grace period.</li>
        <li><strong>Balance-transfer APR</strong> – for balances moved from other cards, sometimes promotional for a limited period.</li>
        <li><strong>Penalty APR</strong> – a higher rate that may apply after late payments, according to your agreement.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Each rate can have its own conditions, such as when it starts, how long it lasts and what events can cause it to change.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Variable APRs and Reference Rates</h2>
      <p>Many credit-card APRs are variable. That means they are linked to a reference rate (for example a central bank or market rate) plus a margin decided by the issuer.</p>
      <p>When the reference rate moves, your APR may move as well, usually with a notice period defined in the terms. The margin component is tied to your card agreement and may reflect factors like underwriting criteria and product type.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Compounding, Fees and Total Cost of Borrowing</h2>
      <p>Interest charges are added to your balance, and future interest may be calculated on this higher amount if the balance is not paid. Some products also include fees such as annual fees, cash-advance fees or balance-transfer fees.</p>
      <p>APR is designed to give a standardized view of costs, but it does not automatically capture every possible scenario. The detailed breakdown of how interest and fees are applied is set out in the pricing and terms documentation for the card.</p>
